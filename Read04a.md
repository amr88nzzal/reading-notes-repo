# JavaScript
**JavaScript** allows us to make web pages more interactive by accessing and modifying the content and markup used in a web page while it is being viewed in the browser.

## ACCESS CONTENT
You can use JavaScript to select any element, attribute, or text from an HTML page. 

## MODIFY CONTENT

You can use JavaScript to add elements, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them. 

## PROGRAM RULES

You can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow (like a recipe), which allows it to access or change the content of a page. 

## REACT TO EVENTS

You can specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurred.

## EXAMPLES OF JAVASCRIPT IN THE BROWSER 

Being able to change the content of an HTML page while it is loaded in the browser is very powerful.

### SLIDESHOWS

Slideshows can display a number of different images (or other HTML content) within the same space on a given page. They can play automatically as a sequence, or users can click through the slides manually. They allow more content to be displayed within a limited amount of space. 

### FORMS
 
Validating forms (checking whether they have been filled in correctly) is important when information is supplied by users. JavaScript lets you alert the user if mistakes have been made. It can also perform sophisticated calculations based on any data entered and reveal the results to the user.

### RELOAD PART OF PAGE

You might not want to force visitors to reload the content of an entire web page, particularly if you only need to refresh a small portion of a page. Just reloading a section of the page can make a site feel like it is faster to load and more like an application.

### FILTERING DATA

If you have a lot of information to display on a page, you can help users find information they need by providing filters. Here, buttons are generated using data in the attributes of the HTML < img > elements.When the user clicks on one of the buttons, they are only shown the images with that keyword.

# SCRIPT

1. A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.
2. A browser may use different parts of the script depending on how the user interacts with the web page.
3. Scripts can run different sections of the code in response to the situation around them.

## WRITING A SCRIPT : 

Start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps. 
### 1. DEFINE THE GOAL
### 2. DESIGN THE SCRIPT 
### 3. CODE EACH STEP

# JS EXPRESSIONS 
An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value.  Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions. 
1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE  
2. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE

=====

# JS OPERATORS
Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.
ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
COMPARISON OPERATORS
LOGICAL OPERATORS
STRING OPERATORS

# JS FUNCTION
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).
