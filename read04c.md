# Dynamic web pages with JavaScript

**JavaScriptis** a programming language mostly used client-side to make webpages interactive. You can create amazing webpages without JavaScript, but JavaScript opens up a whole new level of possibilities.

## How to trigger JavaScript from HTML
Within a browser, JavaScript doesn't do anything by itself. You run JavaScript from inside your HTML webpages. To call JavaScript code from within HTML, you need the `<script>` element. There are two ways to use script, depending on whether you're linking to an external script or embedding a script right in your webpage.

If you view the source code of the page in the browser, the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML, because the script works with the model of the web page that the browser has created.
