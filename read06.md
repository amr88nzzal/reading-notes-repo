# CSS colors

## COLORS IN COMPUTERS
Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of **Red**,
**Green**, and **Blue**. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.

## CSS Opacity

**Opacity** property allows you to
specify the opacity of an element
and any of its child elements.
The value is a number between
**0.0** and **1.0** (so a value of 0.5
is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15%
opacity).

## In RGB

This value is known as an **alpha** value and is
a number between **0.0** and **1.0**
(so a value of 0.5 is 50% opacity
and 0.15 is 15% opacity). The
**RGBA** value will only affect the
element on which it is applied
